Apparently this is what Jamiaca is like.  I wouldn't know as I didn't go anywhere.

Jamaicaâ€™s most energetic city, Montego Bay is both a raucous spring-break party town and a destination for those seeking a more low-key adventure. Known equally for its duty-free shopping, clear-water snorkeling, diverse nightlife and natural beauty, Montego Bay makes for a perfect Jamaican weekend getaway.
